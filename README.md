# Elastic2D_Dipole_GF_Retrieval
This repository contains the numerical demonstration of elastodynamic Green's function (GF) retrieval from the cross-correlation of multiple dipole sources in elastic full space. Programs included: - Analytic Green's function (Imaginary Part), - Analytic derivatives of the GF, representing the exact computation of a dipole source. - Cross-correlations for vectorial sources for random spatial distribution. - Cross-correlations for dipole sources using random spatial distribution. - Number of sources parameter convergence. - L2 Norm computation for both vectorial and dipolar sources respect the imaginary part of GF.
